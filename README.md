Santa Maria Pizzeria App <br>
Test Assigment and Presentational Project

My Stack: <br>
Xcode IDE <br>
Swift <br>
SwiftUI <br>
Alamofire <br>
CoreData <br>
UserDefaults <br>
JSON API <br>
Git, GitHub

An App has 4 main Screens: Onboarding, Menu, Pizza Details and Profile screens.

I used Figma for planning the design and Git and GitHub for ensuring workflow.

Then I collected the array of data in JSON format for storing data and uploaded it to the server.

I started with developing the onboarding flow enabling users to create their accounts, then I worked on setting the navigation flow.

After that, I worked on fetching data from an API using Alamofire framework and storing it locally on a mobile device using CoreData. <br>
I also worked on sorting and filtering the food items here.

I used iPhone 14 Simulator for preview.
